# Evolutiva
Knapsack problem approached with a Genetic Algorithm solution. Two Genetic selectors were used and are available: Elitist Selection and Tournament Selection.

To run the algorithms, you are required to satisfy the following requirements:
- Python 3.6 or above
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

You can use `$ python3 file.py` to define and generate the desired knapsack instance for further analisys and execution.
Use `$ python3 main.py` to execute the code.
The execution starts with the elitist selection and presents the graph when it finds a viable solution.
When you close the first graph window, the program uses the tournament selection and present the corresponding graph.
